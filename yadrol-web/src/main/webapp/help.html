		Yadrol simulates dice rolling and presents roll results or
		calculates the distribution of rolling dice many times.
		Yadrol is designed for tabletop role playing games and boardgames
		enthousiasts that want to study existing dice mechanics or
		that want to create new mechanics.

		You specify a dice mechanic in the text area above, then Yadrol
		simulates the rolls for you.
		The dice mechanic is written as an expression in a language designed
		to capture the most widely used dice mechanics.
		More on that later.
		</p>
		<p> 
		Yadrol has three simulation modes:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				<img height="17ex" src="icons/buttons/dice3.svg">
				&nbsp;Roll
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Yadrol simulates the mechanic once and displays the final
				result on the right.
				The result of an expression is a number.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				<img height="17ex" src="icons/buttons/graph4.svg">
				&nbsp;Sample
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Yadrol simulates the mechanic several times and displays on
				the right a graph that represents the distribution of results.
				By default the simulation is repeated 30,000 times.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				<img height="17ex" src="icons/buttons/dice2.svg">
				&nbsp;Advanced Roll
			</dt>
			<dd>
				This mode works the same way as <em>Roll</em> but it is used
				when the result is not necessarily a number.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
		<em>Sample</em> is the default mode.

		The core expression to specify a dice is <code>NdX</code>, where <code>N</code>
		is the number of dice to roll, and <code>X</code> is the number of sides
		of each die.
		</p>
		<p>
		For instance <code class="tryit" run="true">2d6</code> tells Yadrol to roll two six-sided die.
		</p>

		Oh! And by the way, each time you see an expression example, you can click on it to try it on Yadrol.
