		Yadrol simulates dice rolling and presents roll results or
		calculates the distribution of rolling dice many times.
		Yadrol is designed for tabletop role playing games and boardgames
		enthousiasts that want to study existing dice mechanics or
		that want to create new mechanics.

		You specify a dice mechanic in the text area above, then Yadrol
		simulates the rolls for you.
		The dice mechanic is written as an expression in a language designed
		to capture the most widely used dice mechanics.
		More on that later.
		</p>
		<p> 
		Yadrol has three simulation modes:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				<img height="17ex" src="icons/buttons/dice3.svg">
				&nbsp;Roll
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Yadrol simulates the mechanic once and displays the final
				result on the right.
				The result of an expression is a number.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				<img height="17ex" src="icons/buttons/graph4.svg">
				&nbsp;Sample
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Yadrol simulates the mechanic several times and displays on
				the right a graph that represents the distribution of results.
				By default the simulation is repeated 30,000 times.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				<img height="17ex" src="icons/buttons/dice2.svg">
				&nbsp;Advanced Roll
			</dt>
			<dd>
				This mode works the same way as <em>Roll</em> but it is used
				when the result is not necessarily a number.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
		<em>Sample</em> is the default mode.

		The core expression to specify a dice is <code>NdX</code>, where <code>N</code>
		is the number of dice to roll, and <code>X</code> is the number of sides
		of each die.
		</p>
		<p>
		For instance <code class="tryit" data-run="true">2d6</code> tells Yadrol to roll two six-sided die.
		</p>
		<p class="well">
		Oh! And by the way, each time you see an expression example, you can click on it to try it on Yadrol.
		</p>
		<p>
		Yadrol can roll any type of dice:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the <code class="tryit" data-run="true">d20</code> used in D&amp;D;</li>
			<li>the <code class="tryit" data-run="true">d100</code> used in BRP;</li>
			<li>the <code class="tryit" data-run="true">d8</code> barely used at all;</li>
			<li>the <code class="tryit" data-run="true">d13</code> that doesn't exist at all, but Yadrol can handle it anyway.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="panel-title">About the sample output</h4>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>
		The sample output shows you a graph where the x-axis represent different values obtained by rolling the dice, and the y-axis represent their frequency.
		</p>
		<p>
		By default Yadrol shows the frequency for obtaining <em>at least</em> the value; that is the frequency for obtaining the value <em>or more</em>.
		For instance, if you try rolling <code class="tryit" data-run="true">3d6</code>, the frequency for <em>3 or more</em> is <em>1</em>.
		That makes sense since <em>3</em> is the lowest score you can obtain with 3d6.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can display the curve for <em>exact</em> or <em>at most</em> values with the buttons below the graph.
		</p>
		<p>
		The blue triangle just above the x-axis indicates the weighed mean of the roll.
		You can move this triangle to the <em>mode</em> or the <em>median</em> of the roll with the buttons below the graph.

		Yadrol's language for specifying dice rolls is complete, it has been designed to be able to express most of dice mechanics used in table top RPGs and board games.

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code class="tryit" data-run="true">highest of 2d10</code>: rolls two ten-sided dice and keeps the best one.</li>

		<h4 class="panel-title">Count hits in a dice pool</h4>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>
		<em>Count hits</em> is a type of dice mechanic where one rolls a pool of dice, then counts how many dice shows a result equal or higher than a target value.
		In Yadrol, this can be specified as:
		</p>
		<p>
		<code class="tryit" data-run="true">count (for 6d10 if &gt;= 7)</code>
		</p>
		<p>
		This expression rolls six ten-sided dice and counts how many of them yield seven or more.
		Let's break down this expression and see how it works:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>As you already know <code>6d10</code> rolls six ten-sided dice.</li>
		<li>The <code>for</code>-<code>if</code> construct that encloses the dice roll tells Yadrol to apply a condition <em>for each</em> dice.
		The result of the <code>for</code>-<code>if</code> is the set of dice that satisfy the condition.
		In our expression the condition is <code>&gt;= 7</code>, the dice is seven or more.
		</li>
		<li>Finally the <code>count</code> keyword tells Yadrol to count the selected dice.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Now let's count 1s in a pool of six-sided dice:
		</p>
		<p>
		<code class="tryit" data-run="true">count (for 4d6 if == 1)</code>
		</p>
