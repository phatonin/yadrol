		Yadrol simulates dice rolling and presents roll results or
		calculates the distribution of rolling dice many times.
		Yadrol is designed for tabletop role playing games and boardgames
		enthousiasts that want to study existing dice mechanics or
		that want to create new mechanics.
		</p>

	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>
		You specify a dice mechanic in the text area above, then Yadrol
		simulates the rolls for you.
		The dice mechanic is written as an expression in a language designed
		to capture the most widely used dice mechanics.
		More on that later.
		</p>
		<p> 
		Yadrol has three simulation modes:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				<img height="17ex" src="icons/buttons/dice3.svg">
				&nbsp;Roll
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Yadrol simulates the mechanic once and displays the final
				result on the right.
				The result of an expression is a number.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				<img height="17ex" src="icons/buttons/graph4.svg">
				&nbsp;Sample
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Yadrol simulates the mechanic several times and displays on
				the right a graph that represents the distribution of results.
				By default the simulation is repeated 30,000 times.
			</dd>
			<dt>
				<img height="17ex" src="icons/buttons/dice2.svg">
				&nbsp;Advanced Roll
			</dt>
			<dd>
				This mode works the same way as <em>Roll</em> but it is used
				when the result is not necessarily a number.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
		<em>Sample</em> is the default mode.

	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>
		The core expression to specify a dice is <code>NdX</code>, where <code>N</code>
		is the number of dice to roll, and <code>X</code> is the number of sides
		of each die.
		</p>
		<p>
		For instance <code class="tryit" data-run="true">2d6</code> tells Yadrol to roll two six-sided die.
		</p>
		<p class="well">
		Oh! And by the way, each time you see an expression example, you can click on it to try it on Yadrol.
		</p>
		<p>
		Yadrol can roll any type of dice:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the <code class="tryit" data-run="true">d20</code> used in D&amp;D;</li>
			<li>the <code class="tryit" data-run="true">d100</code> used in BRP;</li>
			<li>the <code class="tryit" data-run="true">d8</code> barely used at all;</li>
			<li>the <code class="tryit" data-run="true">d13</code> that doesn't exist at all, but Yadrol rolls dice in hyperspace.</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="panel-heading">
		<h4 class="panel-title">About the sample output</h4>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>
		The sample output shows you a graph where the x-axis represent different values obtained by rolling the dice, and the y-axis represent their frequency.
		</p>
		<p>
		By default Yadrol shows the frequency for obtaining <em>at least</em> the value; that is the frequency for obtaining the value <em>or more</em>.
		For instance, if you try rolling <code class="tryit" data-run="true">3d6</code>, the frequency for <em>3 or more</em> is <em>1</em>.
		That makes sense since <em>3</em> is the lowest score you can obtain with 3d6.
		</p>
		<p>
		You can display the curve for <em>exact</em> or <em>at most</em> values with the buttons below the graph.
		</p>
		<p>
		The blue triangle just above the x-axis indicates the weighed mean of the roll.
		You can move this triangle to the <em>mode</em> or the <em>median</em> of the roll with the buttons below the graph.

		<p>
		Yadrol's language for specifying dice rolls is complete, it has been designed to be able to express most of dice mechanics used in table top RPGs and board games.
		The next sections are dedicated to teach you the languages constructs through common mechanics.
		The <a href="XXX">Yadrol language reference</a> is available if you need to know everything about the language.

		<h4 class="panel-title">Multiple graphs</h4>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>
		Yadrol allows to compare several roll mechanisms on the same graphs.
		The <code>sample</code> keyword tells Yadroll to add a distribution in the graph.
		For instance <code class="tryit" data-run="true">sample d20</code> tells Yadrol to add to the graph the distribution of one twenty-sided die.
		This is no different than <code class="tryit" data-run="true">d20</code> because by default Yadrol samples the specified expression.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now we can compare two rolls by writing two <code>sample</code> expressions:
		</p>
		<p>
		<code class="tryit" data-run="true">sample d20; sample 3d6</code>
		</p>
